## Part 1: Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the relationship between food stamp recipients and total families in each household from the American Community Survey. 

## Part 2: Proposal for Project

My research question is: Are multi-family households more likely to be food stamp recipients? I hypothesize that multi-family households are more likely to be recipients of food stamps because they experience greater financial strain due to caring for many individuals. Furthermore, multi-family households are common in immigrant families that may in some cases experience greater obstacles in earning income. I will use data from the American Community Survey for the year 2021. The explanatory variable of interest is the "Number of families in household" that is measured from 0-20 in 2021. The outcome variable of interest is "Food stamp recipiency" that is measured with values of N/A, No, and Yes. The observed pattern that would provide support for my hypothesis is observing a correlation between a greater number of families and a "Yes" for food stamp recipiency. Additionally, an increasing pattern of more families correlated with a greater proportion of food stamp recipients would affirm my hypothesis. The observed pattern that would disprove my hypothesis is that the greater number of families per household experiences a relatively low number of food stamp recipients.
